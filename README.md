# SizeMatters
A prototype puzzle game that enables interactive manipulation of object sizes.  The player has multiple rooms to navigate through changing the size of boxes.
Please contact me for inquiries about the source code.

This room gives the player hints on how to manipulate the boxes:

This room requires the player to grow and shrink boxes to navigate above ground by jumping from block to block:

This is another example of a room that the player has to navigate through:
